# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: Cypress

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [develop]
  pull_request:
    branches: [master]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  multiple:
    # example with web application build,
    # server start and waiting for the server
    # to respond before running tests
    # in each Yarn workspaces subfolder
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      # when one test fails, DO NOT cancel the other
      # containers, because this will kill Cypress processes
      # leaving the Dashboard hanging ...
